# PVOS
A CLI-OS Like Application Made Using Customtkinter

I will add an Instructions.txt file later in the 0.2 Version.

For now, just directly run the main.pyw file. If your thinking why i kept this name, it's because before when i was coding in windows I often kept this extension because it prevents the console from running and that's a VERY good thing for python GUI Applications. I will also try to make an windows, linux and also MacOS version of this application like exe.

This app is a little weird because it has the cli command thing but a gui application. so you can say its a mixture of cli and gui.
